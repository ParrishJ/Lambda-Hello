Hello, my name is Jared Parrish and I am a member of the Lambda School Web19 cohort.  I would describe myself as diligent, curious, and thoughtful. 

As spring approaches, I’m happy to return to one of my favorite hobbies which is physical exercise. Over the past year, I have assembled a pretty neat little gym in the garage of my house. As the weather warms up, I’m excited to be spending a lot of time in there again. I also love to use the many awesome trails that are found throughout Eugene, Oregon to ride my bike and to run. 

Thanks for reading!

Hello, my name is Jared Parrish and I am a member of the Lambda School Web19 cohort.  I would describe myself as loud, lazy, and careless. 

I absolutely love watching reality television.  I have many seasons of all of my favorite reality shows recorded and I watch them repeatedly on a regular basis.  I love reality television so much that I do not watch any other kind of television.

Thanks for reading!
